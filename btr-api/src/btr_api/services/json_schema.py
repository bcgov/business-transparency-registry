This Module provides schema validation utilities.

This module offers the `SchemaService` class which provides functionality for loading,
validating and retrieving Json schemas from Json files. It provides methods to validate data against
a specified schema, load a schema from a Json file and return it, and get a schema with a given name.

Usage:
>>> from schema_service import SchemaService
>>> schema_service = SchemaService()
>>> valid, errors = schema_service.validate('schema_name', data)
>>> schema = schema_service.get_schema('schema_name')
